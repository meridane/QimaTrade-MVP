# Supabase migration reconciliation register

**Snapshot date:** 2026-10-27  
**Branch:** `fix/create-offer-status-contract`  
**Status:** INVENTORY ONLY — reconciliation is not complete.

## Evidence captured

- The connected Supabase project's migration history returned 161 applied versions. Latest remote version: `20261026034925 enable_rls_on_unexposed_reference_tables`.
- At the 2026-10-27 snapshot, the repository branch contained 17 SQL migration files in `supabase/migrations/`.
- At that snapshot, the two CREATE_OFFER proposal files below were newer than the reported remote latest version and were not in the remote applied history:
  - `20261027090000_fix_create_offer_action_status_contract.sql`
  - `20261027100000_restrict_direct_create_offer_rpc.sql`
- A count difference does not prove every missing remote migration must be recreated as an individual file. Some historical changes may be represented by a baseline, external/manual changes, or files lost from version control. That must be established from schema and SQL definitions.

## Reconciliation work required

For each of the 161 remote version records, add one row to a future full register with:
1. remote version and migration name;
2. matching tracked file path and file hash, if found;
3. classification: `MATCHED`, `BASELINE`, `MANUAL/EXTERNAL`, `MISSING_SOURCE`, or `UNRESOLVED`;
4. evidence comparing the SQL change to the current live schema;
5. whether the migration is safe/relevant for a clean disposable database;
6. reviewer and resolution note.

The full remote history must be exported without truncation and joined to a complete recursive Git tree of the branch. Do not infer matches from timestamps or similar names alone.

## Safe procedure

1. Read/export the remote schema and migration history only; do not write to production.
2. Download all repository migration files and compare definitions/version IDs.
3. Create a baseline/replay plan only after classifying every remote version.
4. Test the plan in a newly created disposable PostgreSQL/Supabase database.
5. Review grants, RLS, extensions, triggers, functions, and seed data before deciding whether a clean reconstruction is equivalent.
6. Keep any CREATE_OFFER proposals separate until their own authorization and draft-compatibility gates pass.

## Explicit prohibitions for this audit

- Do not run `supabase db reset`, `supabase db push`, or bulk replay against production.
- Do not mark migration parity as passed based only on counts.
- Do not claim this register contains all 161 remote rows; it currently records the verified count, latest version, and all local filenames only.
- No production migration or data mutation was performed for this inventory.


## Branch inventory refresh — 2026-11-07 (read-only)

- The GitHub tree for `fix/create-offer-status-contract` now contains **18** SQL files in `supabase/migrations/`. The 17-row table above is retained as the historical 2026-10-27 snapshot.
- Static comparison found one branch-tracked migration not listed in that snapshot: `20261028180000_fix_message_participant_authorization.sql`.
- The file defines a replacement `public.is_message_participant(uuid, uuid, uuid)` predicate, revokes function EXECUTE from `PUBLIC`, and grants EXECUTE to `authenticated`. Its header says it is branch-only pending review and explicit application to a non-production environment. The repository's security audit also records it as prepared on the branch and not applied to production.
- A fresh read-only `list_migrations` call against the QIMA project failed with PostgreSQL `28P01: password authentication failed for user "postgres"`. No credential was requested, decrypted, or changed, and no retry using secrets was attempted. Therefore the remote applied-migration count/latest version could not be refreshed in this run.
- The earlier remote snapshot (161 applied versions; latest reported `20261026034925`) remains historical evidence dated 2026-10-27 only. It must not be represented as a current 2026-11-07 remote count, nor used to assert whether the newly inventoried message-participant migration is currently applied.
- **Current classification:** branch inventory discrepancy identified and documented; production migration parity remains **UNRESOLVED** until a read-only remote history export can be obtained with working database credentials and matched to the complete Git tree.
- **Safety:** only GitHub repository files and read-only migration metadata were inspected. No `apply_migration`, `execute_sql`, migration replay, data read/write, schema change, grant change, production deployment, PR merge, or branch-protection change was performed.



## QA258 — disposable PostgreSQL execution of the branch-only message migration — 2026-11-07

- The current Git branch has 18 SQL files in `supabase/migrations/`; the 18th file `20261028180000_fix_message_participant_authorization.sql` is now executed unchanged by the isolated GitHub Actions PostgreSQL regression runner.
- `tests/sql/run-legacy-messages-rls-regression.sh` preserves the prior synthetic predicate test, then creates a separate temporary `qima_message_migration_test` database, runs a minimal fixture, applies the actual migration file, executes the migration assertions, and drops the temporary database with a shell EXIT trap.
- The actual function and its PUBLIC/authenticated grants are exercised. INSERT/SELECT policies in the test are minimal synthetic fixtures, not evidence that the live Supabase policies match them.
- QIMA CI #931 [run 42373665792](https://github.com/meridane/QimaTrade-MVP/actions/runs/42373665792) succeeded: 322 Playwright tests, zero failures; CREATE_OFFER integration and both concurrency assertions passed; synthetic legacy RLS passed; actual message-participant migration disposable-db regression passed; participant self-enrollment RLS passed. npm audit reported zero findings at all severities. CodeQL #885 [run 42373665927](https://github.com/meridane/QimaTrade-MVP/actions/runs/42373665927) succeeded.
- The read-only remote `list_migrations` refresh remains blocked by PostgreSQL `28P01` authentication failure. The 161-version remote history recorded on 2026-10-27 remains a historical snapshot, not a current parity result. The migration's applied status on Supabase is unknown.
- No migration was applied to any Supabase project. No production data/schema/policy/grant, migration history, secret, production configuration, or deployment was modified. The test database exists only for the duration of the isolated CI job.



## QA259 — guard destructive test runner database target — 2026-11-07

- The runner `tests/sql/run-legacy-messages-rls-regression.sh` now validates `DATABASE_URL` before the first `psql` call. Only PostgreSQL URIs for `qima_test` on port 5432 with `localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, or `[::1]` are accepted. Remote hosts, another database path, and query-bearing URLs exit with code 2; the URL is not printed.
- New `tests/sql/test-legacy-messages-runner-guard.sh` injects a `psql` stub and verifies three unsafe URL classes are rejected before any database client invocation.
- CI runs this negative guard test immediately before the actual migration test. The positive CI connection remains the isolated service URI `postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/qima_test`.
- QIMA CI #933 [run 42378012790](https://github.com/meridane/QimaTrade-MVP/actions/runs/42378012790) succeeded: 322/322 Playwright; TypeScript, audit, build, PostgreSQL integration, URL guard, actual branch migration disposable-db test, and self-enrollment regression all passed. CodeQL #887 [run 42378012776](https://github.com/meridane/QimaTrade-MVP/actions/runs/42378012776) succeeded.
- The guard does not establish live Supabase migration parity. The remote `list_migrations` refresh is still blocked by PostgreSQL `28P01`; no production connection or mutation was attempted. No migration was applied to any Supabase project.


## QA260 — failure-path cleanup verification for the disposable migration runner — 2026-11-07

- Extended \`tests/sql/test-legacy-messages-runner-guard.sh\` with a mocked valid loopback run. The mock allows the initial regression SQL, pre-clean DROP, temporary database CREATE and migration fixture, then exits 42 when the branch migration file is invoked.
- The test verifies the EXIT trap invokes \`DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS qima_message_migration_test WITH (FORCE)\` after the migration failure and that the runner retains exit status 42 rather than masking the original error.
- Local command \`bash tests/sql/test-legacy-messages-runner-guard.sh\` passed with no PostgreSQL server connection. Existing CI remains responsible for the actual migration execution in the ephemeral PostgreSQL 16 service.
- Code commits: \`0c696cdfc124558ff2f796d6793a6a57f76cea1c\` (test) and \`6ec40fd9eea2f4a7eb4648f8aca86452e16adb83\` (portable expected-event assertion). QIMA CI #936 [run 42383925328](https://github.com/meridane/QimaTrade-MVP/actions/runs/42383925328) and CodeQL #890 [run 42383925301](https://github.com/meridane/QimaTrade-MVP/actions/runs/42383925301) were in progress when recorded.
- This test confirms the cleanup command is attempted and the original exit code is preserved under a deterministic failure. It does not establish cleanup success after a PostgreSQL outage. No Supabase production database or migration was touched.
